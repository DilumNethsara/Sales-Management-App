# Sales-Management-App

This is my first project, a comprehensive Sales Management App developed using Android Studio, SDK version 34, and Java. This app is designed to streamline customer interactions and enhance order processing for sales teams, providing an efficient tool for managing daily operations.

Key Features: User Roles and Permissions: The app supports two main user roles: Admins and Sales Reps. Admins have full access to manage customers, create orders, and assign sales reps to routes and vehicles. Sales reps can view previous invoices, create new orders, and search for customers, ensuring that each user has the tools they need.

Customer Management: Easily add new customers and maintain detailed profiles. The app allows users to search and view customer information, facilitating better customer relationship management.

Order and Invoice Management: Users can create and manage orders seamlessly. Invoices can be generated and previewed within the app, with the capability to print them directly using Bluetooth printers, ensuring a smooth transaction process.

Sales Rep Management: Admins can assign sales reps to specific routes and vehicles, optimizing team logistics and improving route efficiency.

Real-Time Data Synchronization: The app is fully integrated with Firebase, allowing real-time updates and data synchronization with Windows-based software, ensuring that all users have access to the latest information.

Technologies Used: Android Studio: The primary IDE for developing the app, providing powerful tools for Android development.

Java: The programming language utilized for coding the app, ensuring robust and efficient performance.

Firebase: Leveraged for various functionalities, including database management, user authentication, and real-time data updates.

Bluetooth Connectivity: Integrated for seamless printing of invoices directly from the app to connected Bluetooth printers.
